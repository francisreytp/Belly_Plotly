## Project Background
The main goal is to explore the possibility of using some microorganism from human body in developing a synthetic beef product.

Our objective for this project is to parse  information from our sample data (sample.json) and tie those findings in the creation  of the graphical charts:

### Demographic box
We have built our dropdown menu to give us options of selecting our individual samples. In turn this shows us a summary of their demographic description.

### Bar Chart
Each sample are populated with different strings of bacteria, and the the bacteria that has the highest population on that data is what makes up the top ten of our bar chart.

### Bubble Chart
The bubble chart gives us a good visual representation of how the bacteria samples are  distributed in our spectrum.  

### Gauge
As an addition gauge tells us washing frequencies.
